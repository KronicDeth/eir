* Roadmap
** 1. Cleanup
*** Includes fixing all tech dept created leading up to the conference
*** Setting up infrastructure for writing integration tests using the interpreter
**** Ease work for Luke, Paul, improve confidence in high levels of compiler and the runtime
** 2. Basic passes
*** Unified cleanup pass
**** Includes removal of call chains, tail call promotion, closure inlining in one pass.
*** Simple branch elimination pass
**** Removes superfluous branches
** 3. Lower utilities
*** Introduce a barebones more traditional IR (LIR)
**** No passes operate on this (at least for now), eases lowering to other IRs
** 4. Documentation
*** Write gitbook-like documentation for EIR
**** Critical for enabling others to work with the project efficiently
** 5. BEAM assembly target
*** Target BEAM assembly from LIR
**** Enables more easy testing of compiler
**** Comparing our optimization passes with the BEAM compiler
***** Proves our approach of using a Thorin-like IR is beneficial
** 6. Typing infrastructure
*** This is critical for doing good native codegen
